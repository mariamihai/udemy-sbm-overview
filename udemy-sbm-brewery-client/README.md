# Udemy - Initial Brewery project - Spring MVC Brewery Client
## Description
The current project is part of the "Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-with-spring-cloud-beginner-to-guru/). 

The project is an introduction to the course alongside the [Brewery](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-sbm-brewery) project.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-sbm-overview).

## Status
**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the section of the course and the associated project, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
