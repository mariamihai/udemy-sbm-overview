## Description
The current project is part of the "Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-with-spring-cloud-beginner-to-guru/). 

The project adds to the inventory the beers brewed by the [Beer Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-sbm-beer-service) 
and validates the allocation of inventory to an order created by the [Beer Order Service](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-sbm-beer-order-service) 
It removes the allocated inventory and inserts back inventory from cancelled orders.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-sbm-overview).

## API version
_V1_ is the current implementation. No changes to the project are expected to be made in the future that will affect 
the existing endpoints.

## Docker images
Automatic building was not implemented for this project. The `latest` tag contains the best implementation considered 
appropriate to be used.

For automatic building of Docker images check the next projects:
- for [CircleCI](https://github.com/mariamihai/CIToDockerExampleProject)
- for [TravisCI](https://github.com/mariamihai/sma-overview) (all projects implemented under the "Spring Microservices in Action" book)

## Implementation details
### Properties
- the name of the application, used by Eureka and the other services 
```
spring.application.name=beer-inventory-service
```

- application server port
```
server.port=8082
```

### Security
I am using Basic Auth to secure the current project. For better implementations of securing an application, check 
[this](https://github.com/mariamihai/spring-security-amigoscode-tutorial) project.
```
spring.security.user.name=inv
spring.security.user.password=invPass
```

### Profiles
Active profiles: `local`, `local-discovery`.

(The `localmysql` profile was used for the local MySQL connection when starting to develop the services and breaking 
the monolith, the `local` profile is obtained from the Config Service and it is used currently.)

### Additional applications needed
#### MySQL
When running locally, I am using a Docker container for the MySQL databases. Check the Docker Hub [MySQL page](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql).

Creating the container:
```
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name beer-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_pass -d mysql:8
```

The initial script for the project's database is under `src/main/scripts/mysql-init.sql` file.

| Property | Value | 
| --------| -----|
| database name | beersinventoryervice |
| port | 3306 (default) |
| username | beer_inventory_service |
| password | password | 

#### JMS with ActiveMQ Artemis
JMS is used for communication with the Beer Service and Beer Order Service.

Creating the container:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8161:8161 -p 61616:61616 vromero/activemq-artemis
```

The queues related to the current project are:
- `new-inventory` - obtain update with the newly brewed beers from the Beer Service
- `allocate-order` - validates the allocation of an order received from the Beer Order Service
- `allocate-order-response` - sends the result of the allocation to the Beer Order Service
- `de-allocate-order` - receives a deallocation request from the Beer Order Service if the order was invalidated

| Property | Value | 
| --------| -----|
| username | artemis |
| password | simetraehcapa | 

#### Distributed Tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
Creating the Zipkin container:
```
docker run --name zipkin -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```
